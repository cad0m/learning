### Learning Outcomes

Through these projects, I've gained hands-on experience with:

- Translating design mockups into static websites

- Using CSS preprocessors (if applicable)
- Writing semantic HTML

**Note**: These projects were completed as part of a structured learning course. The designs were provided, and I coded them under guidance to learn and apply web development concepts.
